### ConcurRewardPool

sloc : 41

This contract holds the rewards that has to go to Convex LP stakers.

80 % of all rewards will be pushed to stakers and user can claim tokens here.

### ConvexStakingWrapper

sloc : 293

Convex wrapper forked from [convex](https://github.com/convex-eth/platform/blob/main/contracts/contracts/wrappers/ConvexStakingWrapper.sol)

Modified logic is, it is no longer a ERC20, and it will hold all Convex LPs in one contract.

Convex LP holders will stake to this contract all rewards from Convex will be available in ConcurRewardPool.

When user deposits/withdraws LP, it will be notified to MasterChef.

This relies heavily on convex LP contracts and Curve pool contract.

sloc : VoteProxy = 36, EasySign = 223

Vote proxy to enable contract signing with EIP-1271.

### StakingRewards

sloc : 220
